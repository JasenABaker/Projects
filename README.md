## Project One - Jeopardy
A game resembling Jeopardy. Users will be able to select a square with a point value. Then an answer is displayed with a multiple choice of questions to choose from. When a question is selected then the user will find out if it is correct and the points assigned to that answer will be either added or subtracted from their score. After all, questions are selected then a final question is displayed with the user able to wager the collected points. If the user gets the answer correct then the wagered points are added to the total score. If there are two users playing against each other then the scores are compared. The user with the highest score is the winner!
